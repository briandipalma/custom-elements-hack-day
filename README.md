Experimenting with Custom Elements.
===================================

As part of Caplin's Hoverboards and Flying Cars (What cool things should we be doing in 2014 and 2015?) hack day our team decided to investigate Custom Elements - a Web Components spec.

Web Components?
---------------

The [Web Components](http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/explainer/) model consists of four specifications.

* [Templates](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webcomponents/raw-file/tip/spec/templates/index.html)
* [Custom Elements](http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/custom/)
* [Shadow DOM](http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/shadow/)
* [HTML Imports](http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/imports/)
